# Hello! ✨

Some of my favourite projects I've created or contributed to include...

  …automatically (and amusingly) sets your desktop background to your currently timetabled lecturer.

- 🚂 [Next Trains](https://thomasr.me/next-trains/) (2018)  
  …was a Google Assistant action that informed dozens people about their daily commute.

- 🚇 [Rejselog](https://thomasr.dev/rejselog/) (2023)  
  …allows you to easily log rail, metro, and tram journeys made in Denmark.

  …tracked whether Boris Johnson was still Prime Minister.

- 🚀 [BeforeYouGoGo](https://github.com/itsmeimtom/beforeyougogo) (2021)  
  …is a flat-file URL shortener, built to be as simple and as portable as possible.

- 🗺️ [Speedtest.net CSV Mapper](https://thomasr.dev/speedtest.net-csv-mapper) (2020)  
 …was created for [Dan](https://github.com/dwilliamsuk) and [Dav](https://davwheat.dev), to plot Speedtest.net results on a map for easy visualisation.

- 📝 Some of my work from [University](https://port.thomasr.me) and [College](https://solcol.thomasr.me) (2021–2023)  
  …is also public, and available to peruse.
